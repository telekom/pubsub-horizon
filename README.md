# Horizon

A cloud intermediary which handles the asynchronous communication between systems through well defined messages ('events).

## About

Horizon is an event-driven communication platform implementing the publishâ€“subscribe messaging pattern designed to facilitate real-time data exchange and interaction between different components within distributed systems. 
It acts as a central hub for managing event publication, delivery and monitoring, providing a reliable and scalable infrastructure for building event-driven architectures.  

### Lose coupled design
At its core, Horizon enables seamless communication between various microservices, applications, and systems by decoupling producers and consumers through the use of events. 
It allows producers to publish events without needing to know who will consume them, and consumers to subscribe to specific event types they are interested in without needing to know where those events originated.

### Part of Open Telecom Integration Platform

Horizon has been built as a module of the [Open Telecom Integration Platform](https://github.com/telekom/Open-Telekom-Integration-Platform) and therefore fits seamlessly into the overall solution, utilizing the gateway and IDP provided by the suite. However, if desired, Horizon can be operated independently by using any other gateway and IDP implementing OAuth2.

## Features

Horizon simplifies the development of event-driven architectures by providing a unified platform for event management, communication, and monitoring, empowering organizations to build resilient and scalable systems capable of handling real-time data processing and interaction.  

Key features of Horizon include:  


<details>
<summary><strong>RESTful design</strong></summary>  
Horizon allows event providers to publish events by simply calling an API. There is no need to deal with a specific message broker technology and study all the technical details . Receiving events is similarly simple, either by providing an HTTP endpoint for callback requests or by calling a different API. The existing interfaces make it very easy to integrate Horizon with a wide range of applications as the only capability required is to be able to make an HTTP request or receive one.
</details>
<br />
<details>
<summary><strong>Powerful message filtering</strong></summary>  
Horizon's message filtering capabilities are an hybrid of topic-based and contend-based. Published events are processed and delivered to consumers based on the subscriptions to the corresponding event types. Optionally, consumers can declare simple or more complex fltering rules for customizing what data or parts of the data should be delivered to them based on the contents of the event message.   
In addition, event providers can define scopes for their data for fine-grained control over what subscribers are allowed to see. 
</details>
<br />
<details>
<summary><strong>Guaranteed at least once event delivery</strong></summary>  
Horizon ensures reliable and timely delivery of events to subscribers, handling retries, acknowledgments, and error handling to guarantee message delivery even in the presence of network failures or system outages.  
In addition, consumers have the choice between callback-based delivery and delivery via Server-Sent Events (SSE) server-push technology.
</details>
<br />
<details>
<summary><strong>Scalability and reliability</strong></summary>  
Horizon is designed to scale horizontally to handle large volumes of events and subscribers, ensuring high availability and fault tolerance through distributed architecture and redundancy.
</details>
<br />
<details>
<summary><strong>Monitoring</strong></summary>  
Horizon includes monitoring and alerting functionalities to track the health and performance of the event delivery system, providing insights into system behavior and performance metrics.
</details>

## Horizon ecosystem

### Core components

Horizon's runtime consists of 6 microservices, mainly written in Java (SpringBoot):

- [Horizon Starlight](https://github.com/telekom/pubsub-horizon-starlight) (Java): Offers endpoint for validating and publishing event messages.
- [Horizon Galaxy](https://github.com/telekom/pubsub-horizon-galaxy) (Java): Responsible for efficient event message de-multiplexing, managing the flow of events, handling duplicates, and transforming events based on defined filters.
- [Horizon Comet](https://github.com/telekom/pubsub-horizon-comet) (Java): Handles the timely delivery of events to consumers with provided callback endpoint and takes care of retries in case of consumer unavailability.
- [Horizon Pulsar](https://github.com/telekom/pubsub-horizon-pulsar) (Java): Enables the retrieval of events via Server-Sent Event (SSE) technology by offering a corresponding API endpoint.
- [Horizon Polaris](https://github.com/telekom/pubsub-horizon-polaris) (Java): Ensures fallback safety for various issues that could happen at runtime. Periodically checks the availability of consumer endpoints to redeliver unsuccessful events.
- [Horizon Vortex](https://github.com/telekom/pubsub-horizon-vortex) (Go): Ensure state-fulness by saving all event messages and status updates in the database, excluding the payload.

### Libraries
- [Horizon Spring Parent](https://github.com/telekom/pubsub-horizon-spring-parent) (Java): Horizon's parent library which contains basic configuration, functionality and models used by all Horizon Java components.
- [JSON Filter](https://github.com/telekom/JSON-Filter) (Java): Generic purpose library which allows to filter JSON objects based on a given filter expression. Is being used for Horizon's message filtering functionality implemented in Horizon-Galaxy.

### Infrastructure

Horizon requires the following infrastructure components in order to operate correctly:

- **Kubernetes**: Horizon makes use of the Kubernetes API by listening for custom resources which are used to store the runtime configuration that includes event subscriptions
- **Kafka**: Horizon uses Kafka as underlying message broker
- **MongoDB**: Is used to store any meta data, in particular for tracking the status information of each individual event message, which provides information whether the event has reached the consumer successfully or not (event sourcing).

### Add-on functionality

- Voyager*: Horizon service which facilitates event redelivery on demand for failed events by managing event retry policies, maintaining event delivery state, and coordinating event redelivery attempts with subscribers.

### Utilities

- Eventhorizon*: User interface for the Horizon ecosystem, including event information and Circuit-Breaker information.
- Janus*: User interface to check customer endpoints for a valid GET/HEAD response.


**Note, that these optional components are not required in order to deploy and operate Horizon and their source code is currently not publicly available. Depending on our capacity we will be probably working on their open source release among other tools/helpers that might be useful when operating Horizon.*

## Architecture
The diagram below shows the general flow and access points of the most important components of Horizon.
# ![Architecture](./docs/imgs/Horizon-Architecture-Simple.webp)
Customer endpoints are provided by [Starlight](https://github.com/telekom/pubsub-horizon-galaxy-starlight), 
[Pulsar](https://github.com/telekom/pubsub-horizon-galaxy-pulsar)
and 
Voyager. 
Every communication between the components run over Kafka. 
The Vortex component ensures state-fullness by saving all event messages and status updates in the mongodb, excluding the payload.


To publish an event, an eligible publisher has to send a HTTP Post request to Starlights endpoint. Starlight will validate and publish the event message to [Galaxy](https://github.com/telekom/pubsub-horizon-galaxy-galaxy).
Galaxy will multiplex the event message for each subscriber and send it to the [Comet](https://github.com/telekom/pubsub-horizon-galaxy-comet).
Comet will send the event message to the subscriber over HTTP. 

To receive an event, an eligible subscriber has to send a SSE request to Pulsars endpoint. 
Pulsar will validate the request, spot & pick all undelivered event messages from the kafka and return it to the susbscriber.
If one or more new events are available within one minute, Pulsar will forward these event messages to the subscriber until there are no more event messages for one minute.

To query or redeliver an event, an eligible subscriber has to send a HTTP request to Voyagers endpoint. A redelivery spots & picks the event message from the kafka, resets its status and republish them to the Comet.

## Model
Horizon internally uses a model that is crucial for the communication between the Horizon components. These models are:
- [Subscription](https://github.com/telekom/pubsub-horizon-spring-parent/blob/main/horizon-core/src/main/java/de/telekom/eni/pandora/horizon/kubernetes/resource/Subscription.java): Represents a subscription of a subscriber to a specific event type. This subscription is used to filter and deliver event messages to the subscriber.
- [PublishedEventMessage](https://github.com/telekom/pubsub-horizon-spring-parent/blob/main/horizon-core/src/main/java/de/telekom/eni/pandora/horizon/model/event/PublishedEventMessage.java): Represents an event message that is published by a publisher.
- [SubscriptionEventMessage](https://github.com/telekom/pubsub-horizon-spring-parent/blob/main/horizon-core/src/main/java/de/telekom/eni/pandora/horizon/model/event/SubscriptionEventMessage.java): Represents an event message that is multiplexed from a [PublishedEventMessage](https://github.com/telekom/pubsub-horizon-spring-parent/blob/main/horizon-core/src/main/java/de/telekom/eni/pandora/horizon/model/event/PublishedEventMessage.java) by Galaxy for each subscriber.
- [Status](https://github.com/telekom/pubsub-horizon-spring-parent/blob/main/horizon-core/src/main/java/de/telekom/eni/pandora/horizon/model/event/Status.java): Represents the status of a [SubscriptionEventMessage](https://github.com/telekom/pubsub-horizon-spring-parent/blob/main/horizon-core/src/main/java/de/telekom/eni/pandora/horizon/model/event/SubscriptionEventMessage.java).

- [CircuitBreakerMessage](https://github.com/telekom/pubsub-horizon-spring-parent/blob/main/horizon-core/src/main/java/de/telekom/eni/pandora/horizon/model/meta/CircuitBreakerMessage.java): Represents a circuit breaker message that is opened by the Comet on unsuccessful event message delivery to a subscriber, with a retryable error code. Contains information about the subscriber and subscription, the last health check results, the assigned pod, the status of the circuit breaker message (OPEN, CHECKING, REPUBLISHING). 
  One circuit breaker message is created for each subscription, therefore one circuit breaker message exists for multiple event messages.

## CRDs

Horizon is a cloud-native solution that requires to be installed in a Kubernetes environment. It depends on the customer resource definition "Subscription" which must be registered in the Kubernetes cluster before installing Horizon components.

### Subscription CRD

Subscription information is currently stored in "Subscription" custom resources which will be watched by the Horizon components.
